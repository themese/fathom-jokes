# fathom-jokes

App I've made as a technical task for an interview. 

# How to Run

App is set up as a monorepo, you can find the api and the ui folders.
UI can be ran with ```npm run dev``` locally or ```npm start```. For interview processes, I recommend using ```npm run dev``` for simplicity 
and if you want to see the full build ```npm run build```.

API can be ran with the same exact commands.

# Code explanation

API is built on Express with Typescript, as I prefer having typesafety, specially on APIs.

UI is plain TS with Html and CSS.
